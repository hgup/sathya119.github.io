# History
## Two Schools of Thought
- Felix **Mendelssohn** -> Elegant || Apollonian
- Richard **Wagner** -> Passionate || Dionysiac

Both of them can be badly abused -> clear but dry, impatient but you don’t recognize the piece

Both are required. Conductors’ work embraces a very enormous range.

Authority, psychological insight, master of mechanics of conducting, profound perception of inner meaning of music

# Mechanics
## Master the beat
- measure/bars
- subdivisions/beats
- 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 beats -> anything higher can be constructed by these 4
- 1 to the bar (1 beat)
	- Waltz typically go in 3 but then we would be conducting an endless number of beats which would be **exhausting** and **less clear** to the orchestra
- 2 beat
	- one beats down
	- another beats up (its like hitting the top)
- 3 beat
	- one beats down
	- two beats sideways
	- three beats up, all three making a triangle
