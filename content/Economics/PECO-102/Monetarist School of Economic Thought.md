# Background
> NAIRU: Non Accelerating 
> NRT: Natural Rate 

- They extended the classical model to some extent
- Milton Friedman
	- created `NAIRU` and `NRT`
	- Permanent income hypothesis
- $M^S$, money supply is the **most important aspect**
- Changes in the money supply -> Change in the growth of income
- Monetary policy
$$
\Delta{M}^S\uparrow \implies \Delta{y}\uparrow
$$

Private sector is inherently stable, the instability comes from the public sector

## The **Four** Propositions of the Milton Framework
> [!NOTE] Background
>  Monetarists are those people who think *it is more important to regulate the supply of money in an economy, rather than to influence other economic instruments or variables.*
>  Milton Friedman was the major intellectual force in the early development of Monetarism

1. The supply of money is the dominant influence on the national income. $Y = f(M^S)$
2. In the short run the supply of money influcences the real variables i.e., output, $Y$ and employment.
3. In the long run, the influence of money is primarily on the price level and other nominal magnitutes. In the long run,  the real variables such as output and employment are determined by the **real factors** / **supply side factors** such as (a) the efficiency of capital, (b) the efficiency of labour, (c) technology, (d) RnD, (e) Innovation and so on, and not by the monetary factors
4. The private sector is inherently stable. the instability in the economy is primarily the resultant of the government policies (public sector)

Conclusion: The central policy conclusion is, *the stability in the growth of money supply is crucial for a stable economy*. Thus, **Milton Friedman long proposed a _constant money growth rate rule_**^[Money supply should constantly grow].

# The Natural Rate Theory of Unemployment/Output (NAIRU / NRT)
> [!NOTE] Unemployment rate
> always out of 1000
- to understand the NRT we will be using the [[Phillips Curve]]
![[Pasted image 20240917104930.png]]
Natural rate of employment is exogenous
The **first part of the story**: How the phillips curve is downward sloping
- Unemployment was at 6%, and inflation was 0%
- To reduce unemployment, we increased money supply
- Reduced to 4%
- But in the long run inflation increases by 2%
Our aim is not price stability, its reducing unemployment, so our goal is achieved in the short run.

The **second part of the story**:
- the real wage goes down $W/G \downarrow$
- so they cut down employment $U \uparrow$ 
- So, the net result is that 

| $M^S$ | $U$ |     | $\Pi$ |
| ----- | --- | --- | ----- |
|       | SR  | LR  |       |
| 3     | 4   | 6   | 0     |
| 5     | 4   | 6   | 2     |
| 7     | 4   | 6   | 4     |
| 9     | 4   | 6   | 6     |
| 11    | 4   | 6   | 8     |

So, a phillips curve in the long run is **Vertical**


> [!NOTE] Natural Rate Theory of Unemployment
> - This theory, developed by Milton Friedman, where he analyzed / looked at the relationships among output, employment and inflation. The `NRT` states that *there exists an equilibrium level of output $Y$ and an accompayning rate of unemployment $U$ by the **real-side** factors*
> - Changes in aggregate demand due to changes in money supply causes the temperory movement of the economy away from the natural way. But in the long run, the unemployment goes back to the natural level.
> - Thus, in the short run the monetary policy is effective, where as in the long run it is not effective.
> - We will be using the phillips curve to understand this phenomena. The Phillip’s curve shows the negative relationship between unemployment rate $U$ and inflation $\Pi$
> - **Short run**
> 	- Suppose the economy has a natural unemployment rate $U$ of $6\%$ and correspondingly inflation of $0$.

> 	- If the monetary authorities want to bring down the unemployment rate and as a result increase the money supply from $3\%$ to $5\%$.
> 	- Due to this, the economy moves from point $A$ to point $B$. Thereby, reducing the unemployment $U = 6\% \to 4\%$ but at a higher inflation rate of $\Pi = 0\% \to 2\%$.
> 	- Thus, in the short run, the monetary authorities are able to reduce the unemployment rate from its natural level.
> 	So, in the short run, the phillips 
> - **Long run**
> 	- In the long run, the original equilibrium rate is $U = 6\%$ of unemployment and $P_0 = 0$
> 	- As we discussed in the short run, increasing money supply from $M^S = 3\% \to 5\%$ will reduce the unemployment rate from $U = 6\% \to 4\%$ (i.e. from $A \to B$) and at an inflation of $\Pi = 2\%$. But in the long run, as the labour suppliers^[Households] come to anticipate higher inflation, the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate because the households contribute less employment due to fall in the real wage.
> 	- Thus, in the short run, the economy moved from $A \to B$, but in the long run the economy moved from $B \to C$. At, point $C$, the unemployment rate $U = 6\%$  but at a higher rate of inflation $\Pi = 2\%$
> 	- Suppose the money supply further increases to $5\% \to 7\% \to 9\% \to 11\%$ resulting in **temperory reduction** in the unemployment rates from $6\% \to 4\%$ i.e., point $C \to D$, $E \to F$, $G \to H$ but in the longer run, we *simply move up* in the vertical Phillip’s curve i.e., $A \to C$, $C \to E$, $E \to G$, $G \to I$.
> 	- Thus, in the long run **the Phillip’s curve is vertical**
> 	![[Monetarist-School-of-Economic-Thought-2024-09-17-11.30.35.excalidraw.light.svg]]
> **Policy Inference**: The policy makers want to reduce the unemployment rates, so it keeps on increasing the money supply, $M^S$. But the economy ends up at a higher inflation $\Pi=8\%$ with same $6\%$ of unemployment.
> **Policy Implication**: The policy makers cannot peg the unemployment rate at some arbitrarily determined target rate. Attempts to lower the unemployment rate by the monetary authorities will work out only in the short run.
