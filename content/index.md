# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

A place where I share my thoughts and ideas. It's like a personal library, a digital sketchbook, and a thought laboratory all rolled into one.

I am learning to take notes on my laptop during my [[Academic/Economics/index|economics]] classes and make them as efficient as my paper-notebook notes (and better, searchable).

At present, I am preparing for my [[Academic/Actuarial Science/index|Actuarial]] exams, and I post my understanding of its concepts here periodically, starting from [[!Exam 5|Exam 5]].

Apart from these there is a vast domain of things that interest me, I [[explorations/index|explore]] them to expand my view about the world. One of my fascinations and young love, [[Music/index|music]] is something I love to write about.

Whenever, I come across something new I make it a point to find out what it is and [[notes/index|note]] it down immediately as a habit. When these notes connect into ideas, I write my [[thoughts/index|thoughts]] on them.

This digital garden is a place for me (and you) to grow and learn. I hope you enjoy  it as much as I enjoy creating it. I encourage you to leave comments or ask questions. I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights.

## ðŸŒŽ Tour

Sometimes, you will find some notes with a [[mathpad]] where some calculations are performed. You can quickly open up [numbr.dev](https://numbr.dev/#new) to paste these calculations there to verify them (or just for fun).
