As we have seen, there are 3 primary transposition $C$, $B^\flat$ and $E^\flat$^[though, there is also the French Horn that has an $F$ transposition].

> [!question] What does **transposition** even mean?
> It simply means that the instrument you have produces the [[concert]][^1] sound of your transposition when you play *your* $C$. For example, if you play *your* $C$ in a Clarinet in $B\flat$, you get a $B\flat$ sound. Another example, if the conductor asks you to play concert $E\flat$ on your Alto Sax, you will have to play *your* $C$[^2].
## Using the [[Circle of Fifths]] to tackle transposition

The circle of fifths has many [[uses of Circle of Fifths|use cases]], each is a subject of discussion in its own right. However, it can also be used to transpose notes, using this simple technique

- the rule is to move clockwise if you want to know what note to play on *your* instrument to get that sound.
- 1 hour for F horn, 2 hours for $B^\flat$ instruments and 3 hours for $E^\flat$ instruments

Let’s apply the rule: If I have a melody line that goes like this

```
E E F G G F E D C C D E E D D
```

Then on the trumpet in $B\flat$, the notes would look like this:

```
Gb Gb G A A G Gb E D D A Gb Gb E E
```

Each note has just been transposed by 2 hours clockwise, e.g. $E \to G\flat$ 

We can do the same for the Alto Sax, but I suggest you do it and try it out to see if you got it right.

[^1]: the real note, that sounds to the ear as it is written
[^2]:because playing *your* $C$ creates a concert $E\flat$ sound
