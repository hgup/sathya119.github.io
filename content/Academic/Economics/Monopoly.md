# Profits from Monopolist Market

Let $P = 100 - 4q$ be demand function

$C = 50 + 20q$ be cost function

$$
\therefore R = p\cdot{q} = (100 - 4q)q = 100q - 4q^2
$$
$$
MR = 100 - 8q
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\tag{For profit Maximization}
\therefore MR &= MC \\
100 - 8q &= 20\\
q &= 10
\end{align}
$$

$$
\therefore P = 100 - 4 \times 10 = 60
$$
Max $\Pi = 60 \times 10 - \left[ 50 + 20 \times 10 \right] = \fbox{350}$ 

Thus, the monopolist have profit of $350$ by selling opt o/p of 10 units at a price of $50$ per unit.

## Comparison with a competitive firm 

Suppose, the firm is a competitive one, then, it follows a rule $\fbox{MC = P}$

$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{i.e.,  } 20 &= 100 - 4q\\
q &= 20

\end{align}
$$
Since the price is $P = 20$ and the quantity $q = 20$,

Max $\Pi = 20 \times 20 - [50 + 20\times 20] = \fbox{-50}$

Thus, a consumer is getting lesser quantity for more price in monopoly than in perfect competition. Also firm is getting more profit in monopoly than in a perfect competition.

# Price Discrimination

Suppose a monopolist discriminate the price he charges by selling a part of its o/p one price in one market and remaining part at another price in another makret. Suppose the monopolist sells its o/p $q_1$ in first market with price $p_1$ where elasticity is $\eta_1$ and sells its o/p $q_2$ in the second market with price $p_2$ where the elasticity is $\eta_2$.

 $\therefore$  we have $MR_1 = P_1\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_1}\right)$ and $MR_2 = P_2\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\right)$




Let $MC$ be the marginal cost
$\therefore$ For profit max in first market $MR_1 = MC$ 
	and for profit max in second market $MR_2 = MC$ 

Equate $MR$ in each market with $MC$

$$
\therefore MC = MR_1 = MR_2
$$
$$
P_1 \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_1}\right) =  P_2 \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\right)
$$

$$
\therefore \dfrac{P_1}{P_2} =\frac{\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\right)}{\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_1}\right) }
$$
$\implies$ For price discrimination price ratio must be maintained at  $\dfrac{P_1}{P_2} =\frac{\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\right)}{\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_1}\right) }$
$\therefore$ $P_1 = P_2$ if $\eta_1 = \eta_2$. This price discrimination is not possible if the markets are of same elasticities so, a **necessary condition** for the price discrimination is that market must be of different elasticities

Suppose $\eta_1 \neq \eta_2$ and 
$$
\begin{align}
\eta_1 &\gt \eta_2\\
\therefore\dfrac{1}{\eta_1} &\lt \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\\
\therefore-\dfrac{1}{\eta_1} &\gt \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\\
\therefore1-\dfrac{1}{\eta_1} &\gt 1 - \dfrac{1}{\eta_2}\\
\therefore \dfrac{P_1}{P_2} &\lt 1
\end{align}
$$

So, $P_1 \lt P2$
In the first market, price is lesser than second market. Thus, he has to charge lesser price in more elastic market if price discrimination is to be followed.

## Example

$P = 100 - 4q$ and $C =  50 + 20q \implies \dfrac{dc}{dq} = MC = 20$ 
suppose monopolist tries price discrimination by selling his o/p in two markets with demand function

$$
\begin{align}
P_1 &= 80 - 5q_1  &P_2 = 180 - 20q_2 \qquad;\quad q_1 + q_2 = q\\
\\
P_1 &=p_1q_1 = (80 - 5q_1) q_1 \\
&=80q_1 = 5q_1^2\\
\\
P_2 &=p_2q_2 = (180 - 20q_2) q_2 \\
&=180q_1 = 20q_2^2\\
\end{align}
$$

$$
MR_1 = 80 - 10q_1 \qquad MR_2 = 180 - 40q_2 \qquad MC = 20
$$

$\therefore$ For profit maximization $MR_1 = MC$ & $MR_2 = MC$
$$
\begin{align}
80 - 10q_1 = 20 \quad&;\quad180 - 40q_2 = 20\\
\boxed{q_1 = 6}\quad&;\quad \boxed{q_2 = 4}\\
\\
q = 6 + 4 &= 10
\end{align}
$$
$$
P_1 = 80 - 576 = \boxed{10}\qquad;\qquad P_2 = 180 - 20\times 4 = \boxed{100}
$$
$$
\eta_1 = -\dfrac{p_1}{q_1}\cdot\dfrac{dq_1}{dp_1} = -\dfrac{50}{6}\cdot\left(-\dfrac{1}{5}\right) = \dfrac{5}{3} \approx 1.67
$$
$$
\eta_2 = -\dfrac{p_2}{q_2}\cdot\dfrac{dq_2}{dp_2} = -\dfrac{100}{4}\cdot\left(-\dfrac{1}{20}\right) = \dfrac{5}{4} \approx 1.25
$$

Thus, the first market is more elastic than the second one so, he is charging lesser price in the first market than the second market by discrimination of price monopolist gets a profit of $450$ which is more than simple monopolist profit, $350$.
