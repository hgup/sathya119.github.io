# Steps

## Compile Claims Data

- in a development triangle. Standard Procedure

> [!info]- Ask this: “How many development periods are needed?”
> - (should) till development ceases, no change in values across periods thereafter
> - \# of periods can vary by LOB
> 	- [[Short-tailed LOB]] - ultimate claims known fairly quickly
> 	- [[Long-tailed LOB]]  - takes many years to know ultimate claims.

## Calculate [[Age-to-age Development Factors]]

- dev methods assume that losses develop in a multiplicative way from one age to the next. (not additive)

## Calculate Averages

- most common approaches
- Arithmetic Average
- [[Medial average]]
- Geometric Average
- [[Volume Weighted average]]

## Select Claim Development Factors

- determine which factors to use
- there is no right choice
### Factors to keep in mind while selecting

1. Smooth Progression
2. Stability (low variance within each column)
3. Credibility of experience (if not use industry benchmark [[Age-to-age Development Factors]])
4. Changes in patterns: review [[Age-to-age Development Factors|Age-to-age Factors]] to figure out patterns -> reflecting internal and external changes.
5. Qualitative info to check how applicable historical experience is.
6. Shock Losses/Cat Losses may distort factors.

### Three situation when you need to take a call

1. Stability in each column
	- consistent => use **all-year** arithmetic averages
	- patterns changing => rely on more **recent years**... two-year three-year average
2. Volatility in business
	- LOB might be too volatile => recent year [[Volume Weighted average]]
3. Varying [[Age-to-age Development Factors|Age-to-age Factors]]
	- vary widely between accident years
	- anomaly in certain accident years
	- use [[Medial average]]
	
## Select Tail Factor

Historical triangle doesn’t reach ultimate then use a [[Tail Factor]]

Possible approaches for selecting a [[Tail Factor]]:
- [[Fit curves]] to historical development patters and extrapolate beyond
- Perform special studies that include more years of data

## Calculate [[Cumulative Claim Development Factors|CDF]]

## Project Ultimate Claims

- Multiply CDF for each [[Accident Year]] with the Cumulative Paid claims for that [[Accident Year|AY]]
