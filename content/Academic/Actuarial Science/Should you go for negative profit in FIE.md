> [!QUESTION] Should you go for negative [[Underwriting Profit|UW Profit]] percentage in the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]]?

> [!success]- Answer
> - In long tailed lines of business, you get time to invest the capital (premiums) into bonds and securities and earn even more profits than we would have had in the UW profit set
> - In short tailed, that opportunity doesn’t exist and so we shouldn’t gamble on a negative profit percentage.
