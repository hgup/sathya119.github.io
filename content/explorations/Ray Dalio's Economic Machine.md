**How to Economic Machine Works** by [Ray Dalio](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0)

## Three main forces that drive the economy

- Productivity
- Short-term Debt Cycle
- Long-term Debt Cycle

It all starts with [[transaction|transactions]]. An economy is the sum of the transactions that make it up.

[[money]] + [[credit]] = total spending, which drives the economy

[[Price]]  = $\dfrac{\textrm{Amount Spent}}{\textrm{Total Quantity Sold}}$. That arises out of [[transaction|transactions]].

A [[market]] for something (say $X$) is the group of all buyer and sellers for $X$.

All markets together constitute the economy.
The biggest buyer and seller -> Government
- [[Central Government]] (collects [[taxes]] and spends money)
- [[Central Bank]] (controls the amount of money and credit in the economy)

## The story of [[credit]]

I feel he explained it best.

But, I will try to summarize it to the best of my abilities:

[[credit|Credit]] deals with borrowing and lending.
- [[creditor|lenders]] wish to earn more money (through interests that [[debitor|borrowers]] pay)
- [[debitor|borrowers]] need money to
	- buy something they cannot afford
	- accumulate capital to start a new business

When [[interest]] rates are high, rate of borrowing reduces and vice versa.

When [[credit]] is created, it turns into [[debt]].
- debt is an asset to the [[creditor|lender]]
- debt is a liability for the [[debitor|borrower]]
- this asset and liability disappear when the principal and interest are repaid

## Spending Drives the Economy

**When someone spends more, someone earns more [[income]]**

When someone’s income increases, it makes him more [[credit-worthiness|credit-worthy]], why?
- He has the ability of repay (because he has income)
- He has collateral (in the form of valuable assets) in case he cannot repay

## The story of [[productivity]]

Over time as we grow in income, our standard of income increases...

Those who are
- hardworking
- inventive
grow in terms of [[productivity]] and => living standards.

Productivity matters in the long-run (because its effect is too slow to be apparent) and it doesn’t fluctuate much.

But in the short-run, [[credit]] matters more.

## How does [[credit]] lead to growth in the short-run?

Consider a scenario where only productivity matters for growth (and no credit). So, in order for us to grow, the only way is to improve our productivity. End of story. In this case we will have a straight up-trending line...

But in reality we have [[cycles]], and the reason for that is simply [[Human Nature|human nature]] with the fact that we take debt.

**”The Credit today is Debt tomorrow”** by [Ray](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0?t=498)

Credit can be created out of thin air. Most of all what people call [[money]] is actually [[credit]].

In an economy without credit, the only way to increase our spending is by productivity growth, but with credit, we can increase our spending by borrowing.

Credit is:
- bad, when it is used to buy something that is not going to lead to any productivity growth (like buying a TV)
- good, when it improves productivity or generates revenue in some way (like buying a tractor for improved agriculture)
