In this model the [[duopolist]] start with a predetermined set of prices and quantity. They examine whether a deviation from this[^1] by either increase in price or decrease in price can be advantageous.

If they find that a change is not advantageous, they will maintain the initial position itself which is the equilibrium otherwise they will try for change.

Suppose one of the [[duopolist|duopolists]] (say $I$) increased his price, than the other duopolist (say $II$) will find that it is advantageous for him and hence he will keep his price unchanged.

But if one of the [[duopolist|duopolists]] ($I$) decreased his price, then the other ($II$) will also decrease its price, to the extent of maintaining equal share in output.[^2]

Thus, price decrease will follow but not price increase.

Finally, if they find a change is **not advantageous**, they don’t move from their initial position, which itself will become [[equilibrium]]. In this process, there cannot be a [[uniform demand curve]], but an effective [[demand curve]], a part of which is guided for price increase and the other part for price decrease.

Thus, there is a kink[^kink] in the effective demand curve, hence this model is called a [[Kinked Demand Curve Model]].

## Example

$$
\begin{align*}
P_1 &= 100 - 2q_1 - q_2 \qquad &c_1 &= 2.5q_1^2\\
P_2&= 95 - q_1 - 3q_2 \qquad &c_2 &= 25q_2
\end{align*}
$$
Suppose the predetermined price and quantity are $P_1 = 70$, $q_1 = 10$, $P_2=55$ and $q_2 = 10$.

### **CASE A**: Increase in price

Suppose $I$ increases his price from $70$; then $II$ will keep his price unchanged at $P_2 = 55$.
$$
q_2 = \dfrac{40 - q_1}{3}
$$
$\therefore$ $I$’s demand function is given by
$$
\begin{align*}
P_1 &= 100 - 2q_1 - \dfrac{40 - q_1}{3}\\
P_1 &= \dfrac{260 - 5q_1}{3}, \textrm{which is valid for price, } P_1 \gt 70
\end{align*}
$$
Now, looking at the revenue,
$$
\begin{align*}
R_1 &= \dfrac{260q_1 - 5q_1^2}{3}\\
MR_1 &= \dfrac{260 - 10q_1}{3}
\end{align*}
$$
Since, $P_1 \gt 70$, $q_1 \lt 10$
$$
\begin{align*}
\therefore 10q_1 &\lt 100\\
\tag{change sign}
-10q_1 &\gt -100\\
\tag{add 260 OBS}
260 - 10q_1 &\gt 160\\
\dfrac{260 - 10q_1}{3} &\gt 53\frac{1}{3}\\
MR_1 &\gt 53\frac{1}{3}\\
MC_1  &= 5q_1 \lt 50
\end{align*}
$$
$\therefore$ $MR$ and $MC$ cannot be equated $\therefore$ one cannot try for increasing his price.

### **CASE B**: Decrease in price

Suppose $I$ decreases his price $P_1 \lt 70$. Then $II$ will follow by decreasing his price till equal quantity is followed i.e. $\boxed{q_2 = q_1}$.

$\therefore$ $I$’s demand function will be
$$
\begin{align*}
P_1 &= 100 - 2q_1 - q_1\\
\implies P_1 &= 100 - 3q_1
\end{align*}
$$
$R_1 = 100q_1 - 3q_1^2$ and so, $MR_1 = 100 - 6q_1$.

But, $q_1 \gt 10$,[^q>10]
$$
\begin{align*}
6q_1 &\gt 60\\
-6q_1 &\lt -60\\
100 -6q_1 &\lt 100 -60\\
MR_1 &\lt 40\\
\textrm{but, } MC_1 &= 5q_1 > 50
\end{align*}
$$
$\therefore$ $MR$ cannot be equated to $MC$. Thus initial position itself is the [[equilibrium]] position.

[^1]: can be in the form of prices
[^2]: If I increase the price, he will not decrease the price. But if I decrease the price, he also has to decrease the price to stay in competition
[^kink]: #doubt how does this kink arise?
[^q>10]:because of the decrease in the price
