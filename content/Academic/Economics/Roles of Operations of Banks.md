# Introduction

There are countless types of banks and financial Institutions currently operating in the world. Each, aiming to provide a specific set of services, catering to a particular market or type of investor. Banking operations involves the practices and procedures that a bank uses to ensure that customers’ transactions are completed accurately and appropriately
Banks and Insurance companies are [[Financial Institutions]] play a key role in the [[Financial System]]. 
- Banks provide a platform for individuals or businesses to deposit excess money for reasons of safety and provide incentives like interest while allowing for liquidity of their deposits. Also, bank provide loans to individuals who are in need of it. Thus they connect [[creditor]]s and [[debitor]]s
- Insurance companies spread the risk of an individual across a group of similarly risky individuals. Since, accidents can happen only to a few of them by chance, the insureds who don’t get into accidents end up subsidizing losses for other insureds in the group, but get an assurance that they will be covered for a price smaller than what they’d have to pay if they themselves had an accident.

To know their importance, first let’s try to visualize what would have happened in their absence:

- **Without Banks,
	- borrowers would have to look for people who wish to lend money
	- lenders would have to look for people who wish to borrow money
	- there will be a big hassle and security issue during the transfer of money
	- people who don’t wish to take risk will lose real value of their money by leaving them uninvested in their safes at home (else they could have earned interest through a Savings account or FD)
- **Without Insurance Companies**,
	- individuals would always be prone to risk, and would have to bear huge expenses in case of accidents
	- there would be no concept of subsidizing the loss of few individuals of a group, as they will have no formal way to find people who have a similar risk profile, and to see how much money should each individual pay in a group.
