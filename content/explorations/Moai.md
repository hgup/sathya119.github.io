I found this emoji, that we call moai: ðŸ—¿  and I used it quite a lot, perhaps because I was highly influenced by my friend who too used it a lot.

Another friend of mine (who is quite a [[riddler]]) pointed out that I have been using it too much and it was turning into irritation. So, like any other decent human being, I stopped using it.

I was later pointed out by that same friend that I had not been using that emoji anymore and why so. Now I was puzzled. It was the same person who got irritated due to me using the same emojis again and again. And then the same person asks me why I am not using them anymore.

Anyway, here is some information about the Moai right from [[wikipedia]]
