# Background

- goal of any economic model is *higher* economic growth
- one of the most important aspects in macroeconomics -> economic growth

- one of the aims of economy is maximum economic output at **stable prices**
- growth is needed! But it doesn’t give you the full picture
	- does it talk about Standard of Living? **Yes**, it can also be used to improve it
	- but consider this example
		- India is the 5th largest economy (nominal), 3rd in terms of PPP (real)
		- But in terms of per-capita income, we are $\approx$ 114th largest
	- point is that growth is important (necessary) but it is not enough (sufficient)


> [!WARNING] Economic growth is not the ultimate goal, but it surely is important

- similar to *ceiling on desires*[^ceiling]

Growth rate is:
$$
\dfrac{\Delta{y}}{Y} = \dfrac{y_t - y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}}
$$

> What are the factors that will influence you to grow?

> - Def. of Average Demand is absent
> - Rate of Growth of Economy should be greater than Rate of Growth of Population

## Three factors that drive economic growth

1. Quality performance (Productivity)
2. Quantitative -> K, L,...
3. Both Qualitative and Quantitative[^substitution]

## Early views of Economic Growth

### Adam Smith

Division of labor to improve specialization
- Onion cutting example in hostel
- cost comes down

###  Ricardo & Maltose

Stationary state[^sim_natural_rate] 

## Economic growth & Environment

Green GDP: $\textrm{Nominal GDP} - \textrm{Damage done to nature}$
- most of it is on paper
- no real development observed in the world (our lecturer was a student when he first heard about this, now he is teaching us the same, while we hear it like how he did)

In a crude way, research happens just to say that another factor is significant in the model. Much of the work has already been done and its just a marginal improvement.

# Simple Growth Model

## [[Harold Domal Model (1946)]]

According to this model, the two important factors are
- Savings of the Economy - $S$
- ICOR[^icor] - $V$

saving rate, $s$ = $\dfrac{S}{Y}$ where ($S$ is nominal Saving rate and $Y$ is nominal income)

Say,
$ICOR = \dfrac{\Delta{K}}{\Delta{Y}}=v = 4$
meaning, we require 4 unit of capital to **increase output by 1 unit**

In terms of units / money -> ₹4000 of capital required to increase output by ₹1000

- If I invest 4000 now, I get back 1000 each year, so I get back my investment in $4$ years. This is the same as the $ICOR$ value.

> [!TIP] $ICOR$ reflects the productivity

> [!WARNING] $ICOR$ cannot be amended easily
> Efficiency of Capital is very difficult to meddle with in the short run

Saving rate in India right now is about $30\%$

So, the ==growth rate== is
$$
g^* = \dfrac{s}{v} = \dfrac{30\%}{4} = 7.5\%
$$
And India’s growth rate is $7\%$


> [!NOTE]
> $$
> \tag{1}
> g^* = \dfrac{s}{v}
> $$
> 
> Equation (1) which captures the interrelationship between the growth rate $g^*$, saving rate $s$ and the productivity of capital $v$. It **ignores** the role of labor altogether (limitation) thus, taking labor also into consideration is the [[Solow's Model]] of Economic Growth.

## Solow Growth Model | Exogenous G.M. | Neo-classical G.M. | S-S model (1956)

> [!QUESTION] Why Exogenous?
> Essentially, he  added $A$ (technical productivity) to the growth model $Y = Af(k,L)$[^lhs_convention]. He believed that this $A$ is not decided or derived inside the model.


> [!QUESTION] Why do we call it the extension of HD model?
> - Added Labor to the equation
> - Diminishing Returns of $K$ and $L$ separately
> - Constant Returns to Scale[^crs]
> - Technical Progress
> - capital output and capital labour ratio is not fixed


> [!NOTE] Technical Productivity
> $$ Y = AF(K,L) $$
> $A$ captures the state of technical knowledge and overall efficiency.[^productivity]
> ![[Growth Theories & Models 2024-09-20 11.29.05.excalidraw.light.svg]]
> - Due to technical progress, $A$ will increase and the production function shifts upwards (RED) leading to higher levels of output $y_3$ for a given level of factor inputs (i.e. $K$ and $L$). Thus, shift in the production function $\implies$ increase in the productivity of factors.
> - Before technical progress, rise in $k$ from $k_1 \to k_2$ leads to an increase in the level of income $y$ from $y_1 \to y_2$
> - But, due to technical progress which is captured by increase in capital, $A$ shifts the production function upwards so that $y$ rises from $y_1 \to y_3$ even if $k$ stays at $k_1$


[^ceiling]: Ceiling for desires means, you are earning but not consuming everything for yourself, but using it for charity.
[^substitution]: Because of various substitution effects in both capital and labor.
[^sim_natural_rate]: It is like the natural rate theory.
[^icor]: Incremental Capital Output Ratio. The Capital Output Ratio is the ratio between the capital and the output. **How much of capital is required to get one unit of output**? The `I` is incremental (additional unit of capital required to create an additional unit of output)
[^lhs_convention]: generally left hand variables are exogenous, and right hand ones are endogenous
[^crs]: Constant Returns to Scale
[^productivity]: for the same amount of capital and labor  I get more productivity
[^perlabor]: output-per-man-hour or per-labor, to compare productivities in economics.
