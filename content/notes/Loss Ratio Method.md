- this calculates the indicated average **rate change** from the *current rate level*

Indicated Change Factor $=\dfrac{P_I}{P_C} = \dfrac{\frac{L+E_L}{P_C} +\frac{E_F}{P_C}}{1-V-Q_T}$
$$
=\dfrac{\textrm{Loss \& LAE Ratio} + F}{1 - V - Q_T}
$$

Indicated Avg Rate Change = Indicated Change Factor $- 1$

# Methodology

- We need $F$, $V$, $Q_T$
- calculate the **Loss & ALAE Ratio** for each years and average it out.
	- trended ultimate loss & ALAE
		- get Loss and ALAE
		- trend it
	- on-level earned premium
		- get earned premium data
		- bring to CRL
