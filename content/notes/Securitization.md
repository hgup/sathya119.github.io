> [!tldr] Processes of pooling in assets and repacking them into [[Security|securities]] and selling them to [[Investors]]

- banks can pool various financial assets ([[mortgages]], [[loans]] and other receivables) and convert them into securities with this process
- these are sold the investors, creating additional [[liquidity]] in the market

# Examples

## [[Mortgage-Backed Securities]]

- created by pooling [[home loans]]
- sold to investors
- investors earn interests from these [[Mortgage-Backed Securities|MBS]] from the underlying loans[^underlying_loan]

## [[Asset-Backed Securities]]

- using other assets like [[credit card]] receivables, auto loans or student loans

[^underlying_loan]: The original borrower is paying [[mortgages]] to the bank, part of which is interest, those interest payments go to the investors of MBS.
