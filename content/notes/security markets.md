# Background Reading
### 1. **Underwriting Securities**

When companies or governments need to raise capital, they issue securities like stocks (equity) or bonds (debt). Banks, particularly investment banks, help these entities raise funds by underwriting the issuance of these securities. This means the bank buys the securities from the issuer and then resells them to investors, often through public offerings or private placements.

- **Equity Underwriting (IPO)**: For stocks, banks help companies go public through **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)**. The bank values the company, determines the share price, and manages the sale of shares to investors.
- **Debt Underwriting**: For bonds, banks help corporations or governments issue debt instruments and sell them to institutional or retail investors.

### 2. **Creating Financial Products (Securitization)**

Banks can pool various financial assets (like mortgages, loans, or other receivables) and convert them into tradable securities through a process called **securitization**. These securities are then sold to investors, creating additional liquidity in the market. For example, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are created by pooling home loans, and investors buy these MBS to earn interest payments from the underlying loans.

- **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**: Banks bundle individual mortgages into securities, which they then sell to investors.
- **Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)**: These are created from various other assets like credit card receivables, auto loans, or student loans.

### 3. **Market Making and Liquidity**

Banks also act as **market makers**, meaning they help create liquidity by being willing to buy or sell securities at any time. They provide a ready market for buying and selling securities, making it easier for investors to trade. This reduces the cost of trading and encourages more participation in the market.

### 4. **Facilitating Secondary Markets**

Once securities are issued, they are traded in the **secondary market**, where investors buy and sell securities among themselves. Banks often play a role in facilitating these trades by providing brokerage services, running trading platforms, or serving as intermediaries for institutional and retail clients.

### 5. **Advisory Services**

Banks also provide advisory services to companies and governments regarding the issuance of securities. They help issuers structure their securities to be attractive to investors, and offer advice on market timing, pricing, and regulatory compliance.

### 6. **Syndication**

For large bond issues or syndicated loans, multiple banks might come together in a group called a **syndicate** to share the risk of underwriting the securities. This allows for larger offerings that would be too risky or large for a single bank to handle on its own.

### 7. **Managing Investment Funds**

Banks often manage mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds that invest in a wide array of securities. This connects retail and institutional investors to securities markets and helps diversify their portfolios.
