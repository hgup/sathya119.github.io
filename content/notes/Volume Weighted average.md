Letâ€™s say we have the Triangle

| AY   | 12m | 24m | 36m | 48m |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2019 | 102 | 135 | 161 | 160 |
| 2020 | 100 | 120 | 153 |     |
| 2021 | 108 | 153 |     |     |
| 2022 | 110 |     |     |     |
To find the volume-weighted development factor 12-24 month maturity, we use

$$
\dfrac{135+120+153}{102+100+108} = 1.316
$$

> [!tip]  We need to use same number of observations while calculating the average
