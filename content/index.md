This is a place where I share my thoughts and ideas. It's like a personal library, a digital sketchbook, and a thought laboratory all rolled into one.

You'll find notes from my studies in economics and actuarial science. These are the foundations of my knowledge. I studied these subjects in depth and learned a lot about how the world works. For example, I learned about economic theory, financial modeling, and risk management.

But I also explore other things that interest me. I write about music, philosophy, and technology. It's a space where I can think about different topics and share my ideas. For example, I might write about a song I really like or discuss a philosophical question that has been on my mind. I might also share my thoughts on the latest technological advancements.

I also use this place to try out new things. I experiment with different technologies and learn new skills. It's a way for me to put my knowledge into practice and create something new. For example, I might try to build a website using a new framework or learn a new programming language to optimize something I can already do. I record my failures and success alike as you tend to learn more from the prior.

This digital garden is a place for me to grow and learn. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoy creating it. I encourage you to leave comments or ask questions. I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights.
