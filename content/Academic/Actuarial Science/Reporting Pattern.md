![[Reporting Pattern 2024-09-21 15.43.52.excalidraw.light.svg]]
- retroactive date is the date when the policy started. Both [[Claims-made Policy]] and [[Occurrence-based policy]], the accident should have happened after the retroactive date.

## Which is better? Claims-made or Occurrence-based?

1. [[Claims-made Policy]] **cost less to the insurer** because the trending effect (inflationary pressures) are reduced in comparison to occurrence-based policies. (e.g. 2030 occurrences will get trended for 4 more periods to amount to a higher dollar amount)
2. If the **underlying trend changes** then the [[Claims-made Policy]] policy will be closer to the original estimated value because, it gets trended only once per row. Whereas occurrence-based policies have costs that get trended for 3-4 years depending on the lag.
3. If the **reporting pattern changes** (30%, 30%, 20%, 20% to something else)  then there is close to no effect on the [[Claims-made Policy]] relative to occurrence-based policies (0%,0%,0%,100% will have an increase and 100%,0%,0%,0% will have a decrease)
4. [[Claims-made Policy]] data doesnâ€™t have **pure IBNR** because only those claims are covered which are reported. Occurrence-based policy claims however may have IBNR.
5. **Investment income** is higher for [[Occurrence-based policy]] because for example, 2018 claims, you only have to pay for the lag 0 reported claims and can invest the rest of the premium for longer duration to earn higher returns. Whereas, for claims-made policies you have to pay for the previous year claims too.
