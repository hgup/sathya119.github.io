First we should know to make adjustments to each of the components in the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]]:

- [[Loss]]
- [[Loss Adjustment Expenses|LAE]]
- [[Underwriting Expenses|UW Expenses]]
- [[Underwriting Profit|UW Profit]]

> [!Question] Are the current rates being charged appropriate for meeting the profit target at aggregate level?


# Methods 

 1. [[Pure Premium Method]]
 2. [[Loss Ratio Method]]
 
## Comparison

- underlying loss measure (limitations of both, so use the other)
	1. [[Pure Premium Method]] requires exposure data
		- might not be available
		- might not be clearly defined, different sublines of business may cover variety of risk and may have different exposure bases -> makes it difficult to establish a consistent exposure measure.
	2. [[Loss Ratio Method]] requires pure premium at CRL with clearly defined exposures
		- might be difficult to find (premium data)
		- might be difficult to calculate the on-level premium if there is significant change to rating variables where the rating algo is complex
- both methods result in different outputs
	1. [[Pure Premium Method]]
		- useful for new companies
	2. [[Loss Ratio Method]]
		- cannot be used for a new company with no internal historical data
		- helps us measure the average impact on existing policyholders
- both the methods are equivalent but they might produce different results depending on how the CRL of premiums are determined.
