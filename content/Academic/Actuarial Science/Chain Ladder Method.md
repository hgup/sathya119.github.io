> - **Historical** patterns predict **future** development patterns
> - Data should be homogenous (ideally)
> - Homogeneity increases predictive value -> credibility of data

# Steps

## Compile Claims Data

- in a development triangle. Standard Procedure

> [!info]- Ask this: “How many development periods are needed?”
> - (should) till development ceases, no change in values across periods thereafter
> - \# of periods can vary by LOB
> 	- [[Short-tailed LOB]] - ultimate claims known fairly quickly
> 	- [[Long-tailed LOB]]  - takes many years to know ultimate claims.

## Calculate [[Age-to-age Development Factors]]

- dev methods assume that losses develop in a multiplicative way from one age to the next. (not additive)

## Calculate Averages

- most common approaches
- Arithmetic Average
- Medial average
	- highest and lowest values are excluded
	- ($\leq 3$) simply use arithmetic average
- Geometric Average
- [[Volume Weighted average]]

## Select Claim Development Factors

- determine which factors to use
- there is no right choice
