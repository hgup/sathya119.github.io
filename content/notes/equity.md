# Context: Ownership

Equity refers to ownership shares in the company.

A company needs funds to start-up a company, they can raise funds either through [[debt]] or through selling [[equity]], i.e. by selling part of the ownership shares of the company[^stocks] to some investor, who becomes a [[shareholder]] in the company.

This means that the company need not pay back the initial funds that were raised (as the [[shareholder]] already got the ownership in return of that money). The benefit that he reaps are through the **company’s success**, primarily:

1. [[Dividends]]
2. [[Capital Gains]]: The potential increase in the [[stock]]’s price, allowing the shareholder to sell their shares at a profit.

- [[equity underwriting]]

# Context: Selling of Company

Think of equity as the value of a company in terms of money, if I were to sell everything in it.

So, if at present `abc` company has 1 million worth of equipment, resources and products. Then the equity of this company would be 1 million[^1]. Let’s call them assets.

But this is an incomplete definition, for we also have to account for any liabilities[^liabilities] that **will not be transferred**[^transferable] with the sale[^sale] of the company.

So, finally:
$$
\textrm{equity} = \textrm{assets} - \textrm{liabilities}
$$
Though, we should also point out that some of the liabilities may be transferred with the sale and thus it would be accounted for by deductions in the **assets** portion of the sale.

> [!EXAMPLE]- Equity Example
>  Imagine a company called "Tech Solutions" is being sold. The total assets of the company (like real estate, equipment, and accounts receivable) are valued at **\$1 million**. However, the company also has liabilities, such as loans or debts, amounting to **\$200,000**.
>  
>  Now, in the sale agreement, the buyer will not take over $100,000 of the company's debt (this debt stays with the seller). This means the buyer will only take on $100,000 of liabilities.
>  
>    So, the equity in this case is:
>    
>    **Equity = Assets - Liabilities (not transferred with the sale)**
>    
>    **Equity = \$1,000,000 - \$100,000 = \$900,000**
>    
>    The buyer would be purchasing the company based on this equity value of **\$900,000**, assuming \$100,000 in liabilities remain with the seller.


[^1]: The price I would be paid for selling this company
[^sale]: I always thought of the word ‘sale’ as in some shopping market, where we say, this thing is being sold, or is on sale. But I think a better way to think of this is to see the pure grammatical meaning... “The selling of a company” or “Sale of a company” meaning, the act of selling that company. That’s all
[^liabilities]: Liabilities can include some loans that the founder of `abc` had taken to start the company or to buy some machinery or to expand production. Anything that has to be paid out eventually **by the seller**
[^transferable]: Here it means that even if I sell the company, I, the seller will still be obligated to pay out the loans, and I can’t transfer it to the buyer.
[^stocks]: This ownership share is sold typically in the form of [[stock|stocks]]
