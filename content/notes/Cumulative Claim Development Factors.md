 a.k.a [[Cumulative Claim Development Factors|Age-to-ultimate Development Factors]]
 
- each [[Cumulative Claim Development Factors|CDF]] projects the remaining growth through maturity

CDF for a maturity (say at 24 months) can be found by multiplying  $24\to36$ , $36\to48$, $48\to60$ $\dots$ $\to\textrm{Ultimate}$ factors.

For example,
$$
\textrm{CDF at 12 months}= (1.307)(1.224)(0.994) = 1.591
$$
