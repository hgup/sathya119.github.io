# Background
- IS -> Goods market (borrowing) (commodity)
- LM -> Money market

It is an extension of the Keynesian framework.
Keyns stopped with the Aggregate demand and stuff, he never talked about the IS-LM framework.

The basis of the ISLM framework is Keyn’s.

Looks at two market:
	goods market (IS)
	money market (LM)

> [!Warning] Restriction
> Closed Economic Market

BP -> External sector

> [!success] Goal
> How is the equilibrium obtained? How does interest rates affect equilibrium?

$I$ => Investment
$S$ => Savings

> [!question] When is goods market in equilibrium?
>  if $I = S$ (absolute values), if both are in equilibrium we say that the goods market in equilibrium.
$L$ => Liquidity preference

Money is in liquid form:
	how much do I carry in form of cash to meet my various expenses demands

> [!question] When is money market in equilibrium?
> $M_d$ = $M_s$

We derive the $IS$ curve using the **four quadrant approach**. And we do the same for the $LM$ curves.

- the ISLM framework is also used to understand the policies
	- $IS$ -> Fiscal policy (revenue and expenditure of the government)
	- $LM$ -> Monetary policy (money supply)

To summarize:
- Derive the IS-LM curves
- Draw the four quadrant curves
- *Crux of the discussion* when are policies useful, and when are they ineffective?
	- Policy is not useless, it all depends on the state of the economy.

# $IS$ / Product market / Goods (Commodity) Market

- We depend on the Keynesian framework:
	- Equilibrium level of income ($y$, equilibrium level of income)
	- Rate of interest in the product market. ($r$ equilibrium rate of interest)

> [!tip] We look at
> Variation of $r$ and $y$ which equilibriates the goods market

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{1}
y &= c(y - t(y)) + i + g\\
\tag{2}
y -c &= s(y-t(y)) + t(y) = i+g\\
\end{align}
$$

Till now we didn’t discuss what is the **investment** (we were given, it was exogenous). But, now we will see that it is not autonomous, rather induced and it is endogenous.

Predominently, it depends on the ROI^[Rate of Interest] 
$$\tag{3}i = \phi(r)$$.
- Cost of borrowing is high so it will **discourage borrowing for investments**
- Present Discount Value, **PDV for our returns will reduce**.

They compare $C$ (cost of borrowing) and $\rho$ (rate of returns)
- If $C =108$ but your returns $\rho = 104$ then it is not economical to invest
- IF $C = 104$  and the return is $\rho = 104$ then it is equal (worthwhile, no harm)
$$
r \downarrow \implies i \uparrow
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{4}
y &= c(y - t(y)) + g + i(r)\\
\tag{5}
i(r) &= s(y) 
\end{align}
$$

Equation (5) forms the **basis for forming the IS curve**

- Equation (4) describes the pairs^[composition] of $y$ and $r$  that will maintain the product market equilibrium.

For every rise in $r$, the level of income needs to fall.

The $IS$ curve can be derived by looking at the savings -> goods market -> 


> [!NOTE] On the Four Quadrant $IS$ curves
> All the relationships discussed so far, that contribute the location of **equilibrium pairs of $r$ and $y$**, in the product market are summarized in the FQ^[Four quadrant: SE, SW, NW, NE] diagram.
> - SE^[South East]: It reflects the *upside-down* version of $s+t$ as a function of level of income $y$.
> - NW: It reflects government spending and investment which is a decreasing function of rate of interest.
> - SW: It reflects the $45\degree$  which is used to equate $s+t$ (from the **SE** Quad.) and $i+g$ (from the **NW** Quad.) and this is the equilibrium condition for the product market.
> - NE: It reflects the $IS$ curve representing the equilibrium values of $r$ and $y$

### Situations, if $s\uparrow$ or $r\uparrow$ 
$$
s\uparrow \implies y \downarrow \implies i \downarrow \implies r\uparrow
$$

$$
r\uparrow \implies i \downarrow \implies y \downarrow \implies s\uparrow
$$


The benefit of using the $IS$ curve is the cascading effect that it provides.

### Effect of rise in $g$ (expansionary fiscal policy)

> [!note]  Shift in the $IS$ curve due to increase in the government expenditure
> - Rise in $g$ from $g_0$ to $g_1$ would lead to outward shift of the $i+g$ curve in the NW Quad.
> - Rise in $g$ would lead to a rise in $y$ through the multiplier process, assuming investment is unchanged.
> - Thus, rise in $g$ from $g_0$ to $g_1$ would rise the level of income from $y_0$ to $y_1$ at the initial rate of interest $r_1$
> - Since, $r$ is constant and $i$ depends on $r$, the investment is also constant.
> - Thus, rise in $g$^[expansionary fiscal policy] **shifts the $IS$-curve to the right.**

- Why people don’t want to hold money as money?

# Money

$M^d$ is the money demand.

There are three reasons why money is demanded:
- Transactional
- Precautionary Motive
- Speculatory

> [!tip] What is Money Demand?
> ?
## Transactional Motive
Traditional approach: It’s a cumbersome affair to go to the bank so I will just withdraw a large amount of money and hold it for my personal use.
- It depends on the level of income (how much you hold)

$$
T^d = \phi(y)_{+}
$$
## Precautitionary Motive
- Its not about emergency
- Money demanded by the individual to meet his day-to-day expenditure (unexpected expenditure)
	- *Suddenly if I see Jamuns being sold, I might want to buy it but I will not withdraw cash from the bank, rather I will just always keep some cash on me.*
- It too demands on the level of income
	
$$
P^d = \phi(y)_{+}
$$
## Speculative Motive
An individual has wealth $W = 1000$, split into two parts $M=700$ and $B= 300$, out of which he allocates $M = 700 = (T^d = 400) + (P^d = 100) + 200(?)$

He wants to participate in investments in the secondary market.
Say, he buys a perpetual bond:
$$
P_B = \dfrac{A}{r}
$$
So, as

$$
r \downarrow \implies P_B \uparrow \implies M^d \uparrow
$$
$$
r \uparrow \implies P_B \downarrow \implies M^d \downarrow
$$

![[IS-LM-Framework-2024-09-10-10.35.02.excalidraw.light.svg]]

**Liquidity Trap** is a situation where the interest rates don’t drop beyond this point. Any amount of money that you try to pump in is getting trapped.


$$
\tag{5}
M/P = l(r) + R(y)
$$
$$
\tag{6}
M/P = m(r_-,y_+)
$$

## Money Market
Let us assume that money supply, $M^s$ is held constant, which is a function:
$$
\bar{M^S} = M^d = c_0 + c_1y - c_2r
$$
Suppose that the level of income goes up $y\uparrow$,
$$
y\uparrow \implies M^d_{(T)}\uparrow \implies \textrm{DisEQ} \implies M^d \downarrow \implies r\uparrow 
$$
On the contrary,
$$
y\downarrow \implies M^d\downarrow \implies \textrm{DisEQ} \implies M^d\uparrow \implies r\downarrow
$$


> [!NOTE] Money Market Equilibrium
> - where the money supply is fixed exogenously at $M^S_0$ and the money demand curve is sloping downwards which depends on the level of income ($y$) and the rate of interest ($r$).
> - Now, originally $M_S$ and $M_d$ were in equilibrium
> - and if the level of income rises from $y_0$ to $y_1$ to $y_2$, the money market equilibrium interest rate should also increase from $r_0$ to $r_1$ to $r_2$ in order to equilibriate the money market.
> - Thus, for every rise in the level of income The interest rate needs to rise or increase.

>    The LM curve represents the pace of $r$ and $y$ that will keep the money market in equilibrium with a given level of money supply.
>    Thus, the LM curve **slopes positively upwards**

> - The effectiveness of the **Fiscal Policy** depends on whether the *fiscal policy change* is initiated at low or high level of output.
> - The figure shows that the differing effect on $y$ for a given shift in $IS$ curve, depends on the **slope of the $LM$ curve**. 
> - At initial equilibrium of $y_0$ the $LM$ curve was *relatively flat*. This gives a **large fiscal multiplier** and thereby a bigger impact on the level of income.
>  - Whereas, at $y_2$, the level curve is *relatively steeper*^[nearly vertical] with the fiscal multiplier being extremely small. Thereby, lesser impact on the level of income.
>   
>   Thus, the size of the fiscal policy multiplier depends on the slope of the $LM$ curve.

> [!NOTE] Expansionary Monetary Policy
> ![[IS-LM Framework 2024-09-13 10.59.06.excalidraw.light.svg]]
> - The **effect of the monetary policy** would depend on the position of the economy and also the slope of the $LM$ curve itself.
> - The shift in the $LM$ curve will have a **greater effect** on the Level of Income at high levels of income and rate of interest (i.e. $y_2$ and $r_2$) rather than, at the low levels (i.e. $y_0$ and $r_0$) 
> - The expansionary monetary policy will have a lesser impact on the level of income if the $LM$ curve is relatively flatter.
> - Whereas, the monetary policy becomes highly effective when the $LM$ curve slopes steeper.
>   
> Thus, it is highly effective at high levels of income and rate of interest.

> [!summary] Summing Up
> ![[IS-LM Framework 2024-09-13 11.11.01.excalidraw.light.svg]]
> To conclude, the fiscal policy becomes effective at lower levels of income whereas the monetary policy becomes effective at high levels of income
