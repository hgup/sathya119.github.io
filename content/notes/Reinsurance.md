Reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies. It is a way for insurers to manage their risk by transferring portions of their potential liabilities to other insurance companies, called reinsurers. By doing this, an insurance company can limit the amount it would have to pay in the event of large or catastrophic claims, helping to stabilize their financial standing and reduce the likelihood of insolvency.

### Key Reasons for Reinsurance:
1. **Risk Management**: Insurance companies can spread the risk of large or unexpected losses by sharing it with reinsurers.
2. **Capacity Expansion**: Reinsurance allows insurers to underwrite more policies, as they transfer part of the risk, giving them the capacity to cover larger amounts.
3. **Stabilizing Losses**: It helps insurers avoid volatile fluctuations in financial performance by covering large claims.
4. **Capital Relief**: Reinsurance reduces the amount of capital insurers are required to hold, as they are effectively transferring part of their obligations.

### Types of Reinsurance:
1. **Facultative Reinsurance**: This is coverage for a specific individual risk or a defined package of risks. The primary insurer and reinsurer agree to transfer and assume a portion of the risk on a case-by-case basis.
  
2. **Treaty Reinsurance**: A broader agreement in which the reinsurer agrees to cover a portion of the insurance company's risk portfolio (e.g., all auto policies) without the need to negotiate individual risks.

### Example:
Suppose an insurance company insures a large number of properties in a coastal city. To protect itself from the financial devastation of a single hurricane causing widespread property damage, the insurer might purchase reinsurance. If a hurricane hits and the total claims exceed a specified amount, the reinsurance company will step in and cover part of those claims. This way, the insurer doesn't bear the full financial burden alone.
