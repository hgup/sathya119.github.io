- these have been adopted by the [[Board of Directors of CAS]]
- rates developed by insurance companies

# Principles

1. A rate is an **estimate** of **expected value** of ==future costs==.[^prospective]
2. A rate ==provides for all costs== associated with transfer of risk [^sufficiency]
3. A rate provides for all costs  associated with ==an individual risk== [^equity]
4. A rate should be:
	- [p] reasonable
	- [c] excessive
	- [c] inadequate
	- [c] unfairly discriminatory

[^prospective]: the estimation/development of premium happens before the  transfer of risk happens so it is **prospective**. Historical data **aids** in figuring out future experiences and is used so that rates for the future can be developed and not for creating rates for the past. This is why we shouldnâ€™t overly rely on ==historical data==, its just a guide... not the solution.

[^sufficiency]: This ensures that the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]] is balanced at an **Aggregate level** so that the company is financially sound

[^equity]: This means that the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]] is balanced at an **Individual level**. If data for an individual is insufficient, he/she can be grouped into one of the policy groups of similar risks profile and the past experience of individuals of the groups can be aggregated to decide on a rate for the individual.

[^actuarially_sound_rates]: The first three conditions should be satisfied for the rate to be actuarially sound
