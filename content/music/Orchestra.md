# Sequence

It all starts with a **Dream** in $B^\flat$ that ends with $E^\flat$ (nothing really matters, ends at $Pa$, we can go to $Pa \to Ga \to Re \to Sa \to Ni$, which is $D$ so we enter $Dm$ scale), then it goes to **Repitition** in $Dm$ that ends with *You didn’t have to* ($Sa$ $Sa$ $Re$ $Re$ $Sa$) we play the chord progression ($Dm7\flat5\to G \to E\flat$), then start off with **Nature**. It ends with ( $E\flat \to G_{dim} \to A\flat \to A\flat_{m}$ ), and so the glock plays the $B$ and starts off with **Literature**. Finally, it ends with a melody that sounds like its in $G$ major, and thus we can use that as the fifth to resolve to $C$ major and start off with **Restriction**, the narration for which has to be given during the outro of *Literature*. This piece ends with the choir getting the center-stage and saying “LALALALA” (all $Sa$’s). Then we start off with... **Boredom** because you know... its boring... people are yawning... shakers are shaking... steel scales are scaling. It ends with *bols* and a banger but time starts ticking... a clock ticks... why? Because **Fear** is about to engulf the stage with blue lights everywhere... After this we start with the *BASS* song for **Courage**, and end with a banger. (There is a possibility to end with a crescendo here)

# Interpretations
## Dream
It is the famous song “Bohemian Rhapsody” that has a tinge of all emotions... joy, sorrow, what we feel, whatever we wanted to feel, deep-inside desires coming true, yet untrue, like a dream.
## Repitition
For repetition, we’ve chosen “Somebody I used to know”. It is to represent how the human mind unlocks creativity in repetitive mundane tasks. We require constant stimulation, and there’s nothing better than improving something we’ve been doing mechanically.
## Nature
Nature is the best teacher. Humankind has evolved to its current state by drawing inspiration at every step from our Sai Vasundharaa. We’ve selected “Golden Hour” to represent nature, incorporating several elements from nature through it.
## Literature
“Quantum Mechanics“ has been chosen to represent literature as a source of creativity and imagination. Getting inspired by what someone else has already done, to repeat it and see for yourself, or to add on to it, getting hit with that spark of an idea suddenly while reading literature on how something could have been done better or alternatively is what this represents.
## Restriction
A “3-note orchestra” in which the students use only three notes to render Ilayaraja’s concert at Vasudhaiva Kutum has been chosen to showcase restriction. When one is imposed with a restriction of any sort, the mind takes the fight or flight approach. Either it’ll display courage in taking up the opportunity of racing the horses, trying out innovative measures to tackle the restriction imposed, our so called Jugaad, or it’ll fear the outcomes and fly in freight. 
## Boredom
An empty mind is the devil’s kitchen, but satan seems to be a good cook. Boredom more often than not forces the mind to find stimuli in seemingly empty surroundings. A stream of ideas will flush the mind when there’s no fixed end goal one is working towards, which if harnessed in the proper manner can result in tremendous growth of the individual. Working up from finding music in beating random objects to a mellifluous rendition of a jugalbandi is what we’re using to represent boredom.
## Fear
Imagine yourself in a darkened corridoor, with a flickering fluorescent bulb at the far end. As you enter further in your mind starts to imagine all sorts of demons lurking in the shadows that’ll pounce on you the moment you take your next step. They are obviously nothing but your mind playing tricks on you, imagining horrors that dont really exist just because the human mind has evolved to be afraid of the dark from prehestoric times. We’ve chosen “Ratsaasan Theme Song” to portray fear.
## Courage
