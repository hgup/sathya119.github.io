It is an application that allows you to create drawings very quickly and easily. The application itself is very light and thus wonâ€™t bottleneck the workflow. The best part is that we can easily embed these drawings right into our Obsidian notes and get a seamless experience like a notebook where we are allowed to not only write but also draw. I started taking my [[content/Academic/Economics/index|economics]]  notes in a similar fashion, where a lot of graphs and drawings are involved.
