Think of equity as the value of a company in terms of money, if I were to sell everything in it.

So, if at present `abc` company has 1 million worth of equipment, resources and products. Then the equity of this company would be 1 million[^1]. Let’s call them assets.

But this is an incomplete definition, for we also have to account for any liabilities[^liabilities] that **will not be transferred**[^transferable] with the sale[^sale] of the company.

So, finally:
$$
\textrm{equity} = \textrm{assets} - \textrm{liabilities}
$$
Though, we should also point out that some of the liabilities may be transferred with the sale and thus it would be accounted for by deductions in the **assets** portion of the sale.

> [!EXAMPLE]- Equity Example
>  Imagine a company called "Tech Solutions" is being sold. The total assets of the company (like real estate, equipment, and accounts receivable) are valued at **$1 million**. However, the company also has liabilities, such as loans or debts, amounting to **$200,000**.
>  
>  Now, in the sale agreement, the buyer will not take over $100,000 of the company's debt (this debt stays with the seller). This means the buyer will only take on $100,000 of liabilities.
>  
>    So, the equity in this case is:
>    
>    **Equity = Assets - Liabilities (not transferred with the sale)**
>    
>    **Equity = $1,000,000 - $100,000 = $900,000**
>    
>    The buyer would be purchasing the company based on this equity value of **$900,000**, assuming $100,000 in liabilities remain with the seller.


[^1]: The price I would be paid for selling this company
[^sale]: I always thought of the word ‘sale’ as in some shopping market, where we say, this thing is being sold, or is on sale. But I think a better way to think of this is to see the pure grammatical meaning... “The selling of a company” or “Sale of a company” meaning, the act of selling that company. That’s all
[^liabilities]: Liabilities can include some loans that the founder of `abc` had taken to start the company or to buy some machinery or to expand production. Anything that has to be paid out eventually **by the seller**
[^transferable]: Here it means that even if I sell the company, I, the seller will still be obligated to pay out the loans, and I can’t transfer it to the buyer.
