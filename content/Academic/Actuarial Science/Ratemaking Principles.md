description: Principles that guide the ratemaking process
---
- these have been adopted by the [[Board of Directors of CAS]]
- rates developed by insurance companies

# Principles

1. A rate is an **estimate** of **expected value** of ==future costs==.[^prospective]
2. A rate ==provides for all costs== associated with transfer of risk [^sufficiency]
3. A rate provides for all costs  associated with ==an individual risk== [^equity]
4. A rate should be: [^actuarially_sound_rates]
	 ✅reasonable
	❌ excessive
	❌ inadequate
	❌ unfairly discriminatory

# Considerations

1. Exposure Unit: 
	1. Commensurate with risk
	2. Practical
	3. Verifiable
2. [[Actuarial Past Data|Data]]:
	1. Should provide a decent idea about the future
	2. Relevant data includes P.E.L.E. (see [[Actuarial Past Data]])
	3. The data is useful for discerning general trends in the claim frequencies, costs, expenses etc.
3. [[Organization of Data]]:
	1. choice of how data is organized is decided by the **availability**, **clarity** and **simplicity** of data. Also on the nature of insurance coverage
4. Influences of Data:
	1. what are the internal influences on data
	2. what are the external influences on data
5. Adjustments to Data:
	1. should be adjusted to express any historical changes in cost between the historical period from which the data is being taken and period when the rates will be in effect
6. Homogeneity:
	1. organize into similar groups to improve accuracy
	2. groups should have enough number to maintain credibility
	3. balance both
7. Credibility:
	1. “predictive value attached to the dataset”
	2. increase by **make groupings homogenous**   or **increase group size**
	3. group should be big enough to be statistically reliable but should have homogeneity
8. ==Classification Plans==: #doubt
10. Individual Risk Rating:
	1. If individual risk experience is sufficiently credible, impact of group’s credibility should be given less weightage and the premium should reflect more of individual experience
11. Actuarial Judgement:
	1. informed
	2. documented and available for disclosure



[^prospective]: The estimation/development of premium happens before the  transfer of risk happens so it is **prospective**. Historical data **aids** in figuring out future experiences and is used so that rates for the future can be developed and not for creating rates for the past. This is why we shouldn’t overly rely on ==historical data==, its just a guide... not the solution.

[^sufficiency]: This ensures that the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]] is balanced at an **Aggregate level** so that the company is financially sound

[^equity]: This means that the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]] is balanced at an **Individual level**. If data for an individual is insufficient, he/she can be grouped into one of the policy groups of similar risks profile and the past experience of individuals of the groups can be aggregated to decide on a rate for the individual.

[^actuarially_sound_rates]: The first three conditions should be satisfied for the rate to be actuarially sound
