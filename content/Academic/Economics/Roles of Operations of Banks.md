# Introduction

There are countless types of banks and financial Institutions currently operating in the world. Each, aiming to provide a specific set of services, catering to a particular market or type of investor. Banking operations involves the practices and procedures that a bank uses to ensure that customers’ transactions are completed accurately and appropriately
Banks and Insurance companies are [[Financial Institutions]] play a key role in the [[Financial System]]. 
- Banks provide a platform for individuals or businesses to deposit excess money for reasons of safety and provide incentives like interest while allowing for liquidity of their deposits. Also, bank provide loans to individuals who are in need of it. Thus they connect [[creditor|creditors]] and [[debitor|debitors]]
- Insurance companies spread the risk of an individual across a group of similarly risky individuals. Since, accidents can happen only to a few of them by chance, the insureds who don’t get into accidents end up subsidizing losses for other insureds in the group, but get an assurance that they will be covered for a price smaller than what they’d have to pay if they themselves had an accident.

To know their importance, first let’s try to visualize what would have happened in their absence:

- **Without Banks**,
	- **borrowers** would have to look for people who wish to lend money
	- **lenders** would have to look for people who wish to borrow money
	- there will be a big **hassle and security issue** during the transfer of money
	- people who don’t wish to take risk will lose real value of their money by leaving them **uninvested** in their safes at home (else they could have earned interest through a Savings account or FD)
- **Without Insurance Companies**,
	- individuals would always be prone to risk, and would have to bear huge expenses in case of accidents
	- there would be no concept of subsidizing the loss of few individuals of a group, as they will have no formal way to find people who have a similar risk profile, and to see how much money should each individual pay in a group.

# Insurance Operations

## Core Functions

- Risk assessment & [[Underwriting]]
	- Risk assessment refers to putting a number or value on a risk that an insured has exposed himself/herself to
	- The process is undertaken by a team of [[Actuaries]]
	- Their goals are historical data should be used to predict the future claims and base the calculation of premiums on that. Rates should be fair overall and at an individual level
	- For overall fairness, they ensure that all of the insurer’s expenses in the [[Fundamental Insurance Equation]] is covered by the premiums collected by all insureds
	- For individual fairness, they ensure that no individual is subsidizing for someone else's exposures.
	- Finally, they perform those calculations and come up with a [[Rating Manual]] wherein there are various risk groups that each insured can be placed in and be charged the premium accordingly.
- Claims processing
	- This is the part where the policy has already been sold and there has been an accident that caused some loss to the insured. Now, the insured demands for indemnification of his loss.
	- The team will first validate whether the claim is genuine or fraudulent
	- It is always possible to get into a legal court case, in case the insured is unhappy with the indemnification and demands for more or if a third party sues the insured and it is the insurer’s liability to defend the insured as per the policy.
	- The case is closed if the payment of ultimate losses are done. It is also possible that the case can be reopened if new evidence is found or the situation changes that affects the original decision.
- [[Reinsurance]]
	- This is insurance that is sold to insurance companies.
	- Catastrophic losses like [[COVID-19]] cannot be accounted for in advance, and so the premiums will fall short for these losses. Thus, the insurer might want to buy reinsurance to transfer a portion of this risk to a [[Reinsurance]] company.
	- They might also want to do so in order to expand capacity. By having confidence that a portion of risk will be transferred, they can underwrite more policies and have a chance of getting more profitable

[^private_banking]: Larger banks have opened private banking *departments* instead.
[^crm_example]: for an example, say you go to SBI to open a bank account or ICICI to buy life insurance. The bank doesn’t process your request properly, calls you next week, and tells you that you will have to start the process again. So, you leave and go to HDFC bank or Bajaj Finserv to buy insurance. They make you sit, get tea for you, listen to your request, ask you to wait in a waiting room for 20 mins, get back to you in 10 mins and tell you that the process is done.
