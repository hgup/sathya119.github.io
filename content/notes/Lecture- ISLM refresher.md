# Background

Let’s talk about different markets:

- Market
	- Money
		- Money Demand
		- Money Supply
	- Product
		- GDP
		- National

Classical -> money and product market are independent
Keynes -> there is a relationship


Money supply $\uparrow$ => Rate of Investment $\downarrow$ => Investment $\uparrow$ => Employment $\uparrow$ => $y \uparrow$
(Money market changes) => (Product market changes)


> [!info] Kenny didn’t explain the converse

To explain the reverse someone came up with the [[IS-LM Framework]]


ISLM:
- Investment (product)
- Savings (product)
- [[Liquidity Preference]]  (money)
- M (money)


## Point of [[equilibrium]]

Aggregate Demand = Aggregate Supply
$$
AD = C + I
$$
$$
AS = C + S
$$
$$
\begin{align*}
\cancel{C} + I &= \cancel{C} + S\\
 I &=  S\\
\end{align*}
$$
