# Introduction

- in the absence of [[technical progress]] the economy is expected to grow at a constant rate
- $y, K, L \to v$ 


- $sy$ is the net investment
- $(n+d)k$ is the gross investment

- [[capital deepening]]
- [[capital widening]]


> [!tldr] Beauty of the Model
> **Positive effect**: net investment
> **Negative effect**: gross investment (depreciation and boom in population)
> 
> In the long run, both of them are getting used up.
> 
> The economy will eventually converge back to $k^*$

- it is not in the economy’s fate to remain at $k^*$ If there is technical progress, the economy will eventually shift


> [!NOTE] Assumptions
> 
> - We **assume**, there is no change in [[technical progress|technological progress]] / [[productivity]]/ $A$.
> - We assume that the labor force growing over time at an exogenously rate
> $$
> \dfrac{\Delta{L}}{L} = n
> $$
> - We assume that $I = sY$
> - We assume that constant fraction $d$ of the existing capital stock, depreciates each period.
> 	- So the total depreciation is $dk$.

> [!note] Explanation
> 
> The steady state balanced growth is defined to be a situation where $y, k, L$ are growing at the same rate over a period of time.
> $$
> \dfrac{\Delta{Y}}{Y} = \dfrac{\Delta{K}}{K}= \dfrac{\Delta{L}}{L} = n
> $$
> In equilibrium(or [[Steady State - Balanced Growth Model]])  $sy = (n+d)k$   where $sy$ is the investment-per-worker and $(n+d)k$ is the gross-investment-per-worker, which is needed to keep the $k$ unchanged for the labor-force growing at $n$.

>  
>  - The steady-state value of $k$ and $y$ are depicted as $k^*$ and $y^*$.
>  - To the left of $k^*$, $sy \gt (n+d)k$  so,  $\Delta{k} \gt 0$ and thus, $k$ would increase towards $k^*$. ([[capital deepening]])
>  - On the right of $k^*$, our $sy \lt (n+d)k$ so, $\Delta{k} \lt 0$ and thus, $k$ would decrease towards $k^*$. ([[capital widening]])
>    
>   Thus, the $k$ converges to $k^*$ from either directions.
>   
>   In the long run, the steady-state (balanced growth) without [[productivity]] change $Y, K, L$ are growing at the same rate $n$.
>   
>   In the steady-state, the positive impact of investment on $k$, just balances the negative effects of [[depreciation]] and the growth of labor force.

>   # Technical Progress and Growth
>    ![[Steady State - Balanced Growth Model 2024-09-24 09.50.21.excalidraw.light.svg]]
>    - With $A$ remaining unchanged, the system has a tendency to converge at $k^*$.
>    - If there is rise in the productivity from $A \to A'$ even if $s$ unchanged, the economy will move to a new steady state, with higher $k$ and $y$.
>    ## Limitations
> - The [[technical progress]] captured by $A$ has been taken to be determined [[exogenously]]. (we don’t know)
> - This model 
> 	- ignores entrepreneurship
> 	- ignores the strength of the institutions
> - Too much of sticking to[^1] [[INADA conditions]].
