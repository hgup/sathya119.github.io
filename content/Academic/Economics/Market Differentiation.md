# Factors Influencing Market Structure

These are the most prominent factors (but there are more)
## Product Differentiation and Innovation

- process to distinguish products from others in the market
- goal: make it more appealing for **target** audience

- example:
	- tesla
		- we had EV before
		- but they grabbed the capital share by virtue of more features at a more competitive price
## Entry Barriers

- obstacles that make it difficult for new competitors to enter a market.
- various forms
	- high start-up costs
	- brand loyalty
		- Kurkure over kata-kat
	- strict regulatory requirements
		- tough to crack when you are starting out

## Economies of scale

- cost advantages that a business experiences as it *increases its production output*
- the **average** cost per unit typically decreases
- reasons for reduction
	- efficient use of resources
	- bulk purchases -> negotiating price

## Market Profitability

- when you start a new business, you need some demand else you cannot expect to get profits

	- small firms compete against each other
2. Monopoly

3. Duopoly
