title: Hursh Gupta's Digital Garden

![[garden.svg]]

A place where I share my thoughts and ideas. It's like a personal library, a digital sketchbook, and a thought laboratory all rolled into one.

You'll find notes from my studies in [[Academic/Economics/index|economics]] and [[Academic/Actuarial Science/index|actuarial science]]. I study these subjects in depth and learn to look at the world through these lenses.

But I also [[explorations/index|explore]] other things that interest me. I write about [[Music/index|music]], philosophy, and technology. It's a space where I can think about different topics and share my ideas. For example, I might write about a song I really like or discuss a philosophical question that [[thoughts/index|has been on my mind]]. I might also share my thoughts on the latest technological advancements.

I also use this place to document new things that I try out. I [[LABS/index|experiment]] with different technologies and learn new skills. It's a way for me to put my knowledge into practice and create something new[^1]. For example, I might try to build a website using a new framework or learn a new programming language to optimize something I can already do. I record my failures and success alike as you tend to learn more from the prior.

This digital garden is a place for me (and you) to grow and learn. I hope you enjoy [[notes/index|exploring]] it as much as I enjoy creating it. I encourage you to leave comments or ask questions. I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights.
